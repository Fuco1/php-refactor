First, INITFORM are run in the newly created buffer.

Then INITIAL is inserted (it is expected to evaluate to string).
If INITIAL contains | put point there as the initial
position (the character is then removed).  If it contains M, put
mark there (the character is then removed).

Finally, FORMS are run."
